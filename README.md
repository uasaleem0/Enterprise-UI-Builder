# Enterprise UI Builder

**Professional-grade software development with UI-first methodology and enterprise intelligence**

## Overview

Enterprise UI Builder combines the intuitive ease of conversational development with enterprise-grade security, architecture, and quality standards. Build production-ready applications through natural language interaction and visual-first design.

## Core Philosophy

- **UI-First Development**: Design drives architecture, not the other way around
- **Enterprise Intelligence**: Security, quality, and architecture built-in automatically
- **Story-Driven Discovery**: Zero assumptions, build understanding through intelligent conversation
- **Proven Patterns Only**: Battle-tested frameworks and methodologies, no experimental approaches

## System Architecture

### 3-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Enterprise Intelligence Core** (Hidden)
- Security Intelligence: OWASP compliance, vulnerability analysis
- Architecture Intelligence: Scalability patterns, performance optimization
- Quality Intelligence: Proven frameworks, anti-spaghetti enforcement
- Risk Intelligence: Technical feasibility, cost analysis

**Layer 2: Conversational Interface** (Your Experience)
- Story-driven discovery through intelligent questioning
- UI-first design flow with real-time architecture feedback
- Milestone-based approvals and stage progression
- Professional consultant interaction patterns

**Layer 3: Professional Delivery** (Output Quality)
- Enterprise-grade code generation with comprehensive testing
- Robust, scalable, maintainable system architecture
- Security-hardened implementation with industry standards
- Performance-optimized solutions with monitoring

## Core Agents

### @enterprise-consultant
**Role**: Story-driven discovery and requirements specification
