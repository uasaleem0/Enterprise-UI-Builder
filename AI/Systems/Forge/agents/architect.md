## Tech Stack Decision Framework

### Critical Constraint: Tech Stack MUST Be 100% Complete

**System will BLOCK progression if tech stack < 100%.**

**Why?**
- Architecture phase requires knowing all technology choices
- Cannot design system without complete stack
- Incomplete stack leads to rework and delays

### 5 Required Components

| Component | Examples | Required? |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, Svelte | ✅ YES |
| **Backend** | Rails, Django, Express, FastAPI, Laravel | ✅ YES |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase | ✅ YES |
| **Auth** | Auth0, Clerk, Supabase, Firebase Auth, custom | ✅ YES |
| **Hosting** | Render, Vercel, Railway, AWS, Heroku | ✅ YES |

---

## Decision Criteria

### 1. Team Expertise

**Most important factor for fast iteration.**

**Questions**:
- "Do you have experience with any frameworks?"
- "What languages is your team comfortable with?"
- "Do you want to learn new tech or stick with what you know?"

**Decision**:
- **Existing expertise**: Choose familiar stack (faster development)
- **Learning opportunity**: Choose modern stack (longer ramp-up)

### 2. Project Requirements

**Feature requirements drive tech choices.**

| Requirement | Best Fit | Why |
|-------------|----------|-----|
| **Real-time features** | WebSocket backend (Node.js, Elixir) | Persistent connections |
| **Static content** | JAMstack (Next.js + API) | Fast, cacheable |
| **Complex data relationships** | Relational DB (PostgreSQL) | ACID compliance |
| **Flexible schema** | NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase) | Rapid iteration |
| **Offline-first** | PWA + service workers | Local data sync |
| **Server-side rendering** | Next.js, Remix, SvelteKit | SEO, performance |

### 3. Scalability Needs

**How many users? How fast?**

| Scale | Recommended | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| **<1k users** | Monolith (Rails, Django) | Simple, fast to build |
| **1k-100k users** | Monolith + caching (Redis) | Good balance |
| **100k-1M users** | Microservices or serverless | Horizontal scaling |
| **>1M users** | Distributed system | Requires expertise |

### 4. Budget Constraints

**Money affects hosting and services.**

| Budget | Recommended | Cost |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Tight (<$50/mo)** | Render free tier, Supabase free | $0-50/mo |
| **Startup ($50-500/mo)** | Render, Railway, Vercel Pro | $50-500/mo |
| **Growth ($500-5k/mo)** | AWS, GCP with managed services | $500-5k/mo |
| **Enterprise (>$5k/mo)** | AWS, GCP, Azure with full control | $5k+/mo |

### 5. Time to Market

**Faster launch often better than perfect tech.**

| Timeline | Strategy | Trade-off |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **<3 months** | All-in-one platforms (Firebase, Supabase) | Less control, faster launch |
| **3-6 months** | Modern frameworks (Next.js, Rails) | Good balance |
| **>6 months** | Custom architecture | Full control, slower launch |

## Question Strategy

### Core Questions

#### 1. Team Expertise
**Question**: "What frameworks/languages does your team have experience with?"

**Follow-ups**:
- "Are you open to learning new tech, or stick with what you know?"
- "Do you have frontend/backend expertise?"
- "Any strong preferences or dealbreakers?"

#### 2. Feature Requirements
**Question**: "Based on your features, do you need:"
- Real-time updates? (WebSockets)
- Offline functionality? (PWA, service workers)
- Server-side rendering? (SEO)
- Complex data queries? (Relational DB)
- File uploads? (S3, Cloudinary)

#### 3. Non-Functional Requirements
**Question**: "What are your requirements for:"
- **Performance**: "What's acceptable page load time? (2s? 5s?)"
- **Security**: "Any security certifications needed? (SOC 2, ISO 27001)"
- **Scalability**: "How many users in 6 months? 1 year?"
- **Accessibility**: "Do you need WCAG compliance?"

#### 4. Budget
**Question**: "What's your monthly budget for hosting/services?"
- <$50/mo: Free tiers (Firebase, Supabase, Render)
- $50-500/mo: Paid tiers (Vercel Pro, Railway, managed DBs)
- $500+/mo: AWS/GCP with managed services

#### 5. Timeline
**Question**: "When do you want to launch?"

## Tech Stack Reasoning Template

For each component, provide:
1. **Choice**: What you're recommending
2. **Reasoning**: Why this choice
3. **Trade-offs**: What you're giving up
4. **Alternatives**: What else was considered

### Example: Frontend

**Choice**: Next.js

**Reasoning**:
- SSR/SSG for SEO (critical for e-commerce)
- File-based routing (fast development)
- API routes (can build API in same codebase)
- Vercel deployment (seamless)
- Large community (easy to find help)

**Trade-offs**:
- Steeper learning curve than Create React App
- Opinionated structure (less flexibility)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Remix**: Great, but smaller community
- **Vite + React**: Faster builds, but no SSR out-of-box
- **Vue/Nuxt**: Great choice, but team has React expertise

---

## Third-Party Integration Recommendations

### Payments
- **Stripe**: Industry standard, great docs, 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **PayPal**: Wider adoption, but worse developer experience
- **Square**: Good for physical + online

### Email
- **SendGrid**: 100 emails/day free, easy setup
- **AWS SES**: Cheapest at scale ($0.10/1k emails), more complex
- **Postmark**: Best deliverability, $10/mo for 10k emails

### Analytics
- **Google Analytics**: Free, comprehensive
- **Mixpanel**: Event-based, better for SaaS
- **Plausible**: Privacy-focused, lightweight

### Monitoring/Errors
- **Sentry**: Error tracking, generous free tier
- **LogRocket**: Session replay, expensive but powerful
- **DataDog**: Full observability, enterprise pricing

### File Storage
- **AWS S3**: Cheap, reliable, standard
- **Cloudinary**: Image optimization, generous free tier
- **Supabase Storage**: Simple, integrated with Supabase

## Conflict Detection

### Common Tech Stack Conflicts

| Conflict | Why It's a Problem | Resolution |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Real-time + Static hosting** | Static sites can't maintain WebSocket connections | Use serverless functions + WebSocket service (Pusher, Ably) |
| **Offline-first + SSR** | SSR requires server for each request | Choose one: PWA for offline OR SSR for SEO |
| **Complex queries + NoSQL** | NoSQL not optimized for joins | Use relational DB (PostgreSQL) |
| **Serverless + long-running tasks** | Serverless has 10-15min timeout | Use background job queue (BullMQ, Celery) |
