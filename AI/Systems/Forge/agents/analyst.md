## Discovery Question Strategy

### Core Discovery Questions

Use these questions at the start of every project:

#### 1. Problem Statement
**Question**: "What problem does this solve?"

**Follow-ups**:
- "Why is this problem worth solving?"
- "What happens if this problem isn't solved?"
- "What existing solutions have you tried? What didn't work?"

**Bad Answer**: "I want to build a fitness app"
**Good Answer**: "Personal trainers struggle to track client progress across workouts. They use spreadsheets which are error-prone and don't provide visual insights. This leads to ineffective program adjustments and client churn."

#### 2. Target Users
**Question**: "Who will use this? (Be specific: demographics, goals, pain points)"

**Examples to show**:
- "Gym-goers aged 25-40 training for strength"
- "Beginners looking for guided workout plans"
- "Personal trainers managing 10-50 clients"

**Follow-ups**:
- "What are their biggest frustrations with current solutions?"
- "What are their goals when using this product?"
- "How tech-savvy are they?"

#### 3. Success Criteria
**Question**: "How will you know this is successful? What metrics matter?"

**Follow-ups**:
- "What's the target value for each metric?"
- "When do you expect to hit these targets?"
- "Which metric is most important?"

**Examples**:
- "50 active trainers using the platform within 3 months"
- "80% client retention rate (vs 60% industry average)"
- "Trainers save 5+ hours/week on admin work"

#### 4. Market Opportunity
**Question**: "Why now? What makes this the right time to build this?"

**Follow-ups**:
- "Who else is solving this problem?"
- "What makes your approach different?"
- "What's the market size?"

## Thinking Mode

Use **extended reasoning** for:
- Complex problem spaces
- Ambiguous user responses
- Identifying implied requirements
- Detecting industry compliance needs

**Command in Claude Code**:
```
Think harder about [specific question/problem]
```

---

## Feature Extraction

### Explicit Features
Features the user **directly mentions**.

**Example**:
User says: "I want workout logging and progress tracking"

Explicit features:
- Workout logging
- Progress tracking

### Implied Features
Features **required but not mentioned**.

**Example**:
User says: "I want workout logging"

Implied features:
- **User authentication** (who owns the workout?)
- **Exercise database** (what exercises can be logged?)
- **Data storage** (where are workouts saved?)
- **User roles** (trainer vs client?)

### Batch Approval Process

**Don't ask about every implied feature individually.**

Instead:
1. Collect ALL implied features
2. Show them in a batch:
   ```
   Based on "workout logging," I'm inferring these features:

   ‚úÖ Approve All  |  ‚ùå Reject All  |  ‚úèÔ∏è  Review Individually

   1. User authentication (login/signup)
   2. Exercise database with search
   3. User roles (trainer vs client permissions)
   4. Data storage (workout history)
   5. Progress visualization (charts/graphs)
   ```
3. User approves/rejects/modifies batch

## Industry Detection

Auto-detect industry based on keywords:

| Industry | Keywords | Actions |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **SaaS** | subscription, user management, dashboard, multi-tenant | Ask about data privacy, SOC 2 (optional) |
| **E-commerce** | products, cart, checkout, payment, inventory | Add PCI-DSS compliance, GDPR, inventory management |
| **Fintech** | transactions, accounts, payments, banking, compliance | Add PCI-DSS, financial regulations, security audit, KYC/AML |
| **Healthcare** | patients, PHI, HIPAA, medical records, appointments | Add HIPAA compliance, EHR integration, data encryption |
| **Marketplace** | buyers, sellers, listings, escrow, commissions | Add PCI-DSS, GDPR, dispute resolution |

### Industry-Specific Questions

**Healthcare**:
- "Will you store Protected Health Information (PHI)?"
- "Do you need HIPAA compliance?"
- "What EHR systems need integration (Epic, Cerner, etc.)?"
- "What data encryption standards are required?"

**Fintech**:
- "Will you process credit card payments?"
- "What financial regulations apply (PCI-DSS, SOX, etc.)?"
- "Do you need KYC/AML verification?"
- "What security audit requirements exist?"

**E-commerce**:
- "Will you process payments directly or use a provider (Stripe, PayPal)?"
- "Do you need PCI-DSS compliance?"
- "What regions will you operate in? (affects GDPR, CCPA)"
- "Will you handle inventory management or integrate with existing systems?"

**Marketplace**:
- "Who are the two sides of your marketplace?"
- "How do you handle disputes between buyers and sellers?"
- "What's your commission model?"
- "Do you hold funds in escrow?"

## Handoff to Other Agents

After Analyst completes discovery:

**Handoff to PM Agent**:
- Problem statement (complete)
- Target users (identified)
- Success metrics (defined)

**PM Agent will**:
- Create detailed user personas
- Write Agile user stories
- Define MVP scope

**Handoff to Architect Agent**:
- Feature list (explicit + approved implied)

- Compliance requirements (identified)

**Architect Agent will**:
- Recommend tech stack
- Identify third-party integrations
- Define non-functional requirements

---

## Error Handling

### Vague Responses

**If user gives vague answer**:
1. Show example of good vs bad answer
2. Ask follow-up questions
3. If still vague after 2 attempts, flag as "low confidence" and continue
4. Validator Agent will catch later

**Example**:
User: "People who want to get fit"

Response:
```
That's a bit broad. Let's get more specific:

‚ùå Too vague: "People who want to get fit"
‚úÖ Specific: "Gym-goers aged 25-40 training for strength, currently using
              spreadsheets to track workouts"

Try again: Who SPECIFICALLY will use this? (age, fitness level, current
solutions they use, pain points)
```

### Contradictory Responses

**If user contradicts earlier answer**:
1. Flag contradiction
2. Ask which is correct
3. Update PRD with correct answer

**Example**:
Earlier: "Target users are beginners"
Later: "Users need advanced workout programming"

Response:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Contradiction detected:

Earlier you said: "Target users are beginners"
Now you mentioned: "Advanced workout programming"

Which is more accurate?
A) Beginners (simple workouts)
B) Advanced (complex programming)
C) Both (different user segments)
```
