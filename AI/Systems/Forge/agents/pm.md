## User Persona Development

### Minimum Requirement
**At least 2 personas** to show different user segments.

### Persona Template

```markdown
#### Persona: [Name]
**Demographics**: Age, location, occupation, income (if relevant)
**Goals**: What they want to accomplish
**Pain Points**: Current frustrations
**Tech Savviness**: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
**Key Quote**: "[What they'd say about the problem]"

**Motivation**: Why they'd use this product
**Barriers**: What might prevent adoption
**Preferred Features**: What matters most to them
```

### Example: Fitness Tracker App

**Persona 1: Sarah - Personal Trainer**
- **Demographics**: 32, Los Angeles, Personal Trainer, $60k/year
- **Goals**: Manage 30+ clients efficiently, track their progress, adjust programs based on data
- **Pain Points**: Spends 10+ hours/week on spreadsheets, can't visualize client progress, clients forget to log workouts
- **Tech Savviness**: Intermediate
- **Key Quote**: "I spend more time on admin than actual training. I need something that just works."
- **Motivation**: Save time, provide better service, retain clients
- **Barriers**: Cost (small business budget), learning curve
- **Preferred Features**: Client dashboard, progress charts, automated reminders

**Persona 2: Mike - Gym-Goer**
- **Demographics**: 28, New York, Software Engineer, $120k/year
- **Goals**: Track strength gains, follow consistent workout program, see progress over time
- **Pain Points**: Forgets what weight/reps he did last workout, can't see if he's improving, needs accountability
- **Tech Savviness**: Advanced
- **Key Quote**: "I want data. Show me if I'm actually getting stronger."
- **Motivation**: Quantifiable progress, data-driven decisions
- **Barriers**: Too many features (wants simplicity), privacy concerns
- **Preferred Features**: Quick workout logging, progress graphs, PR tracking

## User Story Development

### Agile Format
```
As a [persona],
I want [goal],
So that [benefit].
```

### Priority Levels
- **Must-Have (MVP)**: Cannot launch without this
- **Should-Have (Post-MVP)**: Important, but can wait for v2
- **Could-Have (Future)**: Nice to have, low priority
- **Won't-Have (Out of Scope)**: Explicitly excluded

### Acceptance Criteria
Each story needs **specific, testable criteria**.

**Bad (Vague)**:
```
As a trainer,
I want to see client progress,
So that I can adjust their programs.
```

**Good (Specific)**:
```
As a trainer,
I want to see a client's workout history for the last 30 days,
So that I can identify trends and adjust their program accordingly.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Display last 30 days of workouts in chronological order
- [ ] Show exercise name, sets, reps, weight for each workout
- [ ] Highlight personal records (PRs) in a different color
- [ ] Filter by exercise type (e.g., "Show only squat history")
- [ ] Export data as CSV
```

### Story Mapping to Features

Map each user story to a specific feature:

| User Story | Feature | Priority |
|------------|---------|----------|
| "As a trainer, I want to see client progress..." | Trainer Dashboard - Client Progress View | Must-Have |
| "As a gym-goer, I want to log workouts quickly..." | Workout Logging Interface | Must-Have |
| "As a gym-goer, I want to see my PRs..." | Personal Records Tracking | Should-Have |

---

## MVP Scope Definition

### Must-Have (MVP) - v1.0

**Criteria for Must-Have**:
- Cannot launch without this feature
- Solves the core problem
- Delivers on the primary value proposition
- Essential for target persona's primary goal

**Examples**:
- User authentication (can't have personalized app without it)
- Workout logging (core value proposition)
- Exercise database (required for logging)
- Progress tracking (primary user goal)

### Should-Have (Post-MVP) - v2.0

**Criteria for Should-Have**:
- Enhances the core experience
- Important but not critical for launch
- Can be added based on user feedback
- Increases engagement/retention

**Examples**:
- Social features (workout sharing)
- Advanced analytics (trend analysis)
- Integration with wearables (Fitbit, Apple Watch)
- Custom exercise creation

### Could-Have (Future) - v3.0+

**Criteria for Could-Have**:
- Nice to have, but low ROI
- Serves edge cases or niche users
- Can wait until product-market fit is proven
- May never be built

**Examples**:
- Gamification (badges, achievements)
- Meal planning integration
- Video exercise library
- Marketplace for trainer services

### Won't-Have (Out of Scope)

**Explicitly excluded features** with reasoning:

| Feature | Reason for Exclusion |
|---------|---------------------|
| Live video coaching | Requires complex infrastructure; out of MVP scope |
| Nutrition tracking | Different problem space; focus on workouts first |
| E-commerce store | Not core to workout tracking; adds complexity |
| Multi-language support | English-only for MVP; add based on demand |

---

## MoSCoW Prioritization Framework

**How to prioritize features**:

### Step 1: List All Features
Extract from Analyst Agent's feature list (explicit + approved implied).

### Step 2: Score Each Feature

| Criteria | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Value to User** | 40% | How much does this help the user? |
| **Essential for Core Problem** | 30% | Can we launch without this? |
| **Effort to Build** | 20% | How complex is this? (inverse: lower is better) |
| **Risk** | 10% | How risky is this? (inverse: lower is better) |

**Formula**:
```
Priority Score = (Value × 0.4) + (Essential × 0.3) + ((6 - Effort) × 0.2) + ((6 - Risk) × 0.1)
```

### Step 3: Assign Priority

| Priority Score | Priority Level |
|---------------|----------------|
| 4.0 - 5.0 | Must-Have |
| 3.0 - 3.9 | Should-Have |
| 2.0 - 2.9 | Could-Have |
| < 2.0 | Won't-Have |

### Example: Workout Logging

| Criteria | Score | Weighted |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Value to User | 5 | 5 × 0.4 = 2.0 |
| Essential | 5 | 5 × 0.3 = 1.5 |
| Effort (low effort = high score) | 4 | (6-2) × 0.2 = 0.8 |
| Risk (low risk = high score) | 4 | (6-2) × 0.1 = 0.4 |
| **Total** | | **4.7** → **Must-Have** |

## Question Strategy

### Core Questions

#### 1. User Personas
**Question**: "Let's create user personas. For each person who'll use this, tell me:"
- Demographics (age, occupation, income if relevant)
- Goals (what they want to accomplish)
- Pain points (current frustrations)
- Tech savviness (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

**Follow-ups**:
- "What would this person say about the problem you're solving?"
- "What might prevent them from using your product?"
- "What features matter most to them?"

#### 2. User Stories
**Question**: "For [Persona Name], what are the key things they need to DO with this product?"

**Framework**:
- Show Agile format: "As a [persona], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
- Ask for 3-5 stories per persona
- Prioritize by importance

**Example**:
```
For Sarah (Personal Trainer):

1. As a trainer, I want to see all my clients in one dashboard,
   so that I can quickly check who needs attention.

2. As a trainer, I want to view a client's workout history,
   so that I can track their progress and adjust programs.

3. As a trainer, I want to send workout plans to clients,
   so that they know what to do each session.
```

#### 3. MVP Scope
**Question**: "What MUST be in v1.0 to launch? What can wait for v2?"

**Framework**:
- Show Must/Should/Could/Won't categories
- For each feature, ask: "Can you launch without this?"
- Document reasoning for deferrals

**Trade-off Questions**:
- "Would you rather launch in 3 months with basic features, or 6 months with advanced features?"
- "What's the minimum viable product that solves the core problem?"
- "What can you learn from users before adding more features?"
