## Critical Blockers (Hard Blocks)

**System CANNOT proceed if any exist.**

### 1. Missing Tech Stack

**Condition**: `tech_stack_completion < 100%`

**Check**:
```
Required components:
✅ Frontend: [framework]
✅ Backend: [framework]
✅ Database: [type]
✅ Auth: [provider]
✅ Hosting: [platform]
```

**If ANY missing**:
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Tech Stack Incomplete

Missing components:
❌ Backend language/framework
❌ Hosting platform

Reason: Cannot design architecture without complete tech stack.
        Need to know all technology choices before proceeding.

Resolution: Answer these questions:
1. What backend language/framework? (Rails, Django, Express, FastAPI, etc.)
2. Where will you host? (Render, Vercel, Railway, AWS, etc.)

Agent: architect
```

### 2. Conflicting Features

**Condition**: `feature_conflicts_detected > 0`

**Common Conflicts**:

| Conflict | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Real-time + Static hosting | Static sites can't maintain WebSocket connections |
| Offline-first + SSR | SSR requires server for each request |
| Complex queries + NoSQL | NoSQL not optimized for joins/complex relationships |
| Serverless + long tasks | Serverless has 10-15min timeout limits |

**Detection Logic**:
```javascript
if (features.includes('real-time') && hosting === 'static') {
  conflicts.push({
    feature1: 'Real-time updates',
    feature2: 'Static site hosting',
    reason: 'Static sites cannot maintain WebSocket connections',
    resolution: 'Use serverless functions + WebSocket service (Pusher, Ably) OR choose dynamic hosting'
  });
}
```

**Output**:
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Conflicting Features Detected

Conflict #1:
Feature 1: Real-time collaboration
Feature 2: Static site hosting (Vercel static export)

Reason: Static sites cannot maintain persistent WebSocket connections
        required for real-time features.

Resolution (choose one):
A) Remove real-time features (use polling instead)
B) Change hosting to dynamic (Next.js on Vercel, not static export)
C) Use third-party service (Pusher, Ably) for real-time

Which do you prefer?
```

### 3. Low Confidence

**Condition**: `overall_confidence < 95%`

**Output**:
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Confidence Below Threshold

Current: 80.50%
Target: 95.00%
Gap: -14.50%

Reason: PRD too vague to proceed to architecture phase.
        High risk of rework and scope creep.

To reach 95%:
1. Complete User Stories (+5.00%) → 85.50%
2. Complete MVP Scope (+7.50%) → 93.00%
3. Complete Success Metrics (+3.75%) → 96.75% ✅

Run: forge status (for detailed breakdown)
Run: forge fix low_confidence (for guidance)
```

### 4. Vague Features

**Condition**: `feature_list_completion < 75%`

**Detection Logic**:
- Feature has no acceptance criteria
- Acceptance criteria are vague (e.g., "works well")
- Feature description < 20 characters

**Output**:
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Features Too Vague

Found 5 features without clear acceptance criteria:

1. ❌ "User dashboard"
   → Missing: What data is shown? How is it displayed?

2. ❌ "Payment system"
   → Missing: Payment methods? Subscriptions? One-time?

3. ❌ "Analytics"
   → Missing: What metrics? What visualizations?

Examples of specific features:
✅ "User dashboard showing: workout history (last 30 days), progress
    charts (weight/reps over time), upcoming scheduled workouts,
    personal records"

✅ "Stripe integration for: monthly subscriptions ($9.99/mo), annual
    plans ($99/year with 2 months free), payment method management,
    invoice history"

Resolution: Add acceptance criteria to each feature defining:
- What data/content is shown
- How users interact with it
- What actions they can take
- What the result looks like

Agent: analyst
```

### 5. Missing Compliance

**Condition**: `industry_compliance_required && compliance_plan_missing`

**Industries Requiring Compliance**:

| Industry | Required Deliverables | Why |
|----------|----------------------|-----|
| Healthcare | HIPAA Compliance Plan, PHI Handling, Data Encryption | Stores Protected Health Information |
| Fintech | PCI-DSS Compliance, Financial Regulations, Security Audit | Processes payments / financial data |
| E-commerce | PCI-DSS Compliance, GDPR/Privacy Policy | Processes payments |

**Output** (Healthcare example):
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Industry Compliance Plan Missing

Detected Industry: Healthcare

Required deliverables:
❌ HIPAA Compliance Plan (not addressed)
❌ PHI Handling Protocol (not addressed)
❌ Data Encryption Specification (not addressed)

Reason: Healthcare apps handling Protected Health Information (PHI)
        must comply with HIPAA regulations. Cannot launch without
        compliance plan.

Critical questions:
1. Will you store PHI (Protected Health Information)?
2. Do you need HIPAA compliance?
3. What EHR systems need integration (Epic, Cerner, etc.)?
4. What data encryption standards are required?

Resolution: Add HIPAA compliance deliverables to PRD (adds 10% to
           confidence calculation).

Agent: analyst
```

---

## Warnings (Non-Blocking)

**System warns but DOES NOT block if overall confidence ≥ 95%.**

### 1. Unclear MVP Scope

**Condition**: `mvp_scope_completion < 75%`

**Output**:
```
⚠️  WARNING: MVP Scope Unclear (50%)

Risk: Scope creep and delayed launch without clear v1 vs v2 definition.

Current state:
- Must-Have (MVP): 8 features defined
- Should-Have (Post-MVP): Not defined
- Could-Have (Future): Not defined
- Won't-Have (Out of Scope): Not defined

Impact: Warning only - does not block progression if overall confidence ≥ 95%

Resolution: Clearly define:
- What's in MVP (v1.0)
- What's deferred to v2+
- Why each item is in/out
- Timeline estimate (optional)

Agent: pm
```

### 2. Missing Success Metrics

**Condition**: `success_metrics_completion < 75%`

**Output**:
```
⚠️  WARNING: Success Metrics Incomplete (50%)

Risk: No clear definition of "success". May build features that don't
      drive desired outcomes.

Current state:
- KPIs defined: 2
- Target values: Missing
- Measurement methods: Vague
- Timeline: Not specified

Impact: Warning only - does not block progression if overall confidence ≥ 95%

Resolution: Define 3-5 KPIs with:
- What to measure (e.g., "Monthly Active Users")
- Target value (e.g., "500 MAU by month 3")
- How to measure (e.g., "Google Analytics")
- When to measure (e.g., "Monthly review")

Agent: pm
```

## Confidence Calculation

### Formula
```
Confidence = Σ (Deliverable_Completion × Weight)
```

### Weights
```javascript
const weights = {
  feature_list: 0.25,          // 25%
  tech_stack: 0.20,            // 20%
  success_metrics: 0.15,       // 15%
  mvp_scope: 0.15,             // 15%
  problem_statement: 0.10,     // 10%
  user_personas: 0.07,         // 7%
  user_stories: 0.05,          // 5%
  non_functional: 0.03         // 3%
};
```

### Example Calculation
```javascript
const deliverables = {
  feature_list: 100,           // 100% complete
  tech_stack: 100,             // 100% complete
  success_metrics: 75,         // 75% complete
  mvp_scope: 50,               // 50% complete
  problem_statement: 100,      // 100% complete
  user_personas: 75,           // 75% complete
  user_stories: 0,             // 0% complete
  non_functional: 50           // 50% complete
};

const confidence =
  (deliverables.feature_list * weights.feature_list) +
  (deliverables.tech_stack * weights.tech_stack) +
  (deliverables.success_metrics * weights.success_metrics) +
  (deliverables.mvp_scope * weights.mvp_scope) +
  (deliverables.problem_statement * weights.problem_statement) +
  (deliverables.user_personas * weights.user_personas) +
  (deliverables.user_stories * weights.user_stories) +
  (deliverables.non_functional * weights.non_functional);

// confidence = 80.50%
```
