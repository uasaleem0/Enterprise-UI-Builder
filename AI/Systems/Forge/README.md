# Forge v1.0
**AI-Powered Software Development System: Idea â†’ PRD â†’ Production**

Transform vague ideas into production-ready applications through confidence-based PRD development, multi-agent analysis, and automated GitHub setup.

---

## What is Forge?

Forge is a structured, confidence-based system that guides you from a vague idea to a production-ready PRD (Product Requirements Document) in 2-4 hours, then scaffolds a complete GitHub repository with CI/CD, test infrastructure, and atomic issues ready for development.

**Core Philosophy**:
1. **95% Confidence Threshold** - No phase advances without clarity
2. **Atomic, Specific Issues** - Granular, self-contained tasks
3. **Test-First Foundation** - CI/CD before features
4. **Fresh Context Per Issue** - Clear between work items

---

## System Architecture

### Phases

**Phase 1: PRD Development** âœ… (Current)
- Multi-agent discovery and analysis
- Weighted confidence tracking (95% threshold)
- Industry-specific compliance integration
- Dual workflow: from scratch OR import existing PRD

**Phase 2: GitHub Foundation** âœ… (Current)
- Repository scaffolding with CI/CD
- Test framework setup
- Atomic issue generation
- Scratchpad planning system

**Phase 3: Architecture** ðŸ”œ (Future)
- System design and data models
- API specifications
- Component architecture

**Phase 4: Implementation** ðŸ”œ (Future)
- Iterative feature development
- Test-driven development
- PR review workflows

---

## Confidence System

### Weighted Formula

```
Confidence = Î£ (Deliverable_Completion Ã— Weight)

Weights:
- Feature List: 25%
- Tech Stack: 20%
- Success Metrics: 15%
- MVP Scope: 15%
- Problem Statement: 10%
- User Personas: 7%
- User Stories: 5%
- Non-Functional Requirements: 3%
```

### Hard Blocks (Critical)

System **CANNOT** proceed if:
1. **Tech Stack < 100%** - All 5 components required (frontend, backend, database, auth, hosting)
2. **Conflicting Features** - E.g., real-time + static hosting
3. **Overall Confidence < 95%** - PRD too vague
4. **Vague Features** - Missing acceptance criteria
5. **Missing Compliance** - Healthcare (HIPAA), Fintech (PCI-DSS), etc.

---

## Agent System

### Analyst Agent (BMAD-Inspired)
**Focus**: Problem space, target users, market opportunity

**Outputs**:
- Problem Statement (10% weight)
- Success Metrics (15% weight)
- Feature extraction (explicit + implied)

### PM Agent (BMAD-Inspired)
**Focus**: User personas, Agile stories, MVP scope

**Outputs**:
- User Personas (7% weight)
- User Stories in Agile format (5% weight)
- MVP Scope definition (15% weight)

### Architect Agent
**Focus**: Tech stack decisions (100% required)

**Outputs**:
- Complete tech stack with reasoning (20% weight)
- Third-party integrations
- Non-functional requirements (3% weight)

### Validator Agent
**Focus**: Completeness, conflicts, clarity, compliance

**Outputs**:
- Validation report with blockers
- Confidence calculation
- Next steps to reach 95%

## Workflows

### From-Scratch Workflow

```
1. forge start my-app
   â”œâ”€ Analyst asks discovery questions
   â”œâ”€ PM creates personas and stories
   â”œâ”€ Architect defines tech stack
   â””â”€ Validator checks completeness

2. Reach 95% confidence
   â””â”€ Iterate until all deliverables complete

3. forge setup-repo my-app
   â”œâ”€ Copy GitHub templates (CI/CD, issues, PRs)
   â””â”€ Create scratchpads directory

4. git init + gh repo create
   â””â”€ Initialize repository

5. forge generate-issues
   â””â”€ Convert PRD features into atomic GitHub issues

6. FOR EACH ISSUE:
   â”œâ”€ forge issue <N>
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ Plan â†’ Create â†’ Test â†’ Deploy
   â”‚  â””â”€ Opens PR
   â”œâ”€ Review PR
   â”œâ”€ Merge PR
   â””â”€ /clear (in Claude Code)
```

### Import-PRD Workflow

```
1. forge import my-app ./prd.md
   â”œâ”€ Validator parses existing PRD
   â”œâ”€ Calculates initial confidence (40-80%)
   â””â”€ Identifies gaps

2. Fill gaps with targeted questions
   â””â”€ Ask ONLY about missing items

3. Reach 95% confidence
   â””â”€ Iterate until validated

4. forge setup-repo my-app
   â””â”€ [Same as from-scratch workflow]
```

---

## GitHub Flow Integration

Based on the GitHub workflow best practices:

**Issue Processing** (Plan â†’ Create â†’ Test â†’ Deploy):

1. **Plan Phase**:
   - Fetch issue from GitHub via `gh` CLI
   - Search `scratchpads/` for related work
   - Break into atomic tasks
   - Write plan to `scratchpads/issue-<N>-plan.md`

2. **Create Phase**:
   - Implement code changes
   - Follow framework best practices

3. **Test Phase**:
   - Run test suite (npm test, rails test, pytest)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Use Puppeteer for UI testing

4. **Deploy Phase**:
   - Commit changes
   - Open pull request
   - CI/CD runs automatically
   - Review PR (human or separate Claude session)
   - Merge to main
   - Main auto-deploys (optional)

5. **Clean Context**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Run `/clear` in Claude Code after merge
   - Prevents context pollution
   - Next issue works from cold start

Q: "Who will use this?"
A: "Trainers managing 10-50 clients, gym-goers tracking workouts"

Q: "How will you know it's successful?"
A: "50 active trainers within 3 months, 80% retention rate"

# Continue until 95% confidence...

# Setup GitHub
