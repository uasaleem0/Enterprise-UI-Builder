# Meta-Analyst Activation Protocol

## ðŸ¤– Automatic Detection System

The meta-analyst now has **real-time pattern detection** that will interrupt conversations when critical failures occur.

### **How It Works**

**1. Pattern Scanning:**
Every AI response is automatically scanned for trigger phrases:
- "I can see", "looking at", "visual analysis" â†’ Visual hallucination alert
- User requests method X, AI does method Y â†’ Instruction violation alert
- Definitive claims without evidence â†’ False confidence alert
- Claims beyond AI capabilities â†’ Capability mismatch alert

**2. Immediate User Notification:**
When detected, the meta-analyst will immediately post:
```
ðŸš¨ META-ANALYST ALERT: [Specific issue detected]
âš ï¸ RECOMMENDED ACTION: [What user should do]
```

**3. Session Logging:**
All detections logged to: `Enterprise/.meta-analyst/session-log.md`

### **Key Improvements Made**

#### **Before (Why It Failed):**
- Meta-analyst only monitored "efficiency" and "protocol adherence"
- No detection for **visual hallucination** or **capability mismatches**
- No **instruction compliance** tracking
- No **evidence validation** for confident claims

#### **After (Fixed):**
- âœ… **Visual Capability Verification**: Flags any image analysis claims
- âœ… **Instruction Adherence Monitoring**: Tracks user requests vs AI actions
- âœ… **Evidence-Based Confidence Validation**: Requires proof for claims
- âœ… **Capability vs Claim Validation**: Checks AI abilities against claims
- âœ… **Real-Time User Alerts**: Immediate notification, not just logging

### **Testing the System**

To verify the meta-analyst works, try these trigger phrases in your next conversation:
1. "I can see the design looks professional" â†’ Should trigger visual hallucination alert
2. Give explicit instruction, AI ignores it â†’ Should trigger instruction violation alert
3. AI claims "95% match quality" without evidence â†’ Should trigger false confidence alert

### **Expected Meta-Analyst Response Example**
```
ðŸš¨ META-ANALYST ALERT: Visual analysis hallucination detected. 
AI cannot view images but claimed to see design quality.

âš ï¸ RECOMMENDED ACTION: Request user-led visual feedback instead of AI assessment.
```

The meta-analyst should now catch these issues **immediately** and notify you, not after the fact.
