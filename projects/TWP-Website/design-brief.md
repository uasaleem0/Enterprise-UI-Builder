# Design Brief - The Wisdom Practise
**Project**: TWP Coaching Website  
**Design Philosophy**: Inward-focused, grounded, anti-stimulation professional design

## Core Design Values
- **Raw Authenticity**: Cave-like, clay-sculpted textures without being obvious
- **Groundedness**: Deep, stable, present-moment feeling
- **Breathable Space**: "Take a breath and say 'wow, this is it'"
- **Anti-Coaching**: Nothing that resembles traditional coaching/course websites
- **Professional Depth**: Sharp execution of organic, natural elements

## Visual Direction

### **Overall Aesthetic**
- **Mood**: Inward reflection, groundedness, non-reactive calm
- **Feeling**: Deep diving into awareness, self-discovery through scrolling
- **Inspiration**: High-end architectural/wellness brands, cave-like depth, clay/stone textures
- **Theme**: Dark/charcoal base with warm accent colors

### **Color Palette** (From Company Brand Guidelines)
- **Primary**: Charcoal (deep, grounding base)
- **Accent 1**: Rust (warm, earthy depth)  
- **Accent 2**: Sand Beige (natural, calming)
- **Text/Contrast**: Off-white (soft, breathable)

### **Typography System**
- **Font Style**: Serif fonts for warmth and sophistication
- **Spacing**: Generous white space between letters, words, and sections
- **Hierarchy**: Clear focus with lots of breathing room
- **Readability**: Large, unhurried text that feels contemplative

### **Layout Philosophy**
- **Single Point of Focus**: Not overstimulating, one clear element at a time
- **Generous Spacing**: Lots of white space between sections
- **Progressive Revelation**: Content unveils as you scroll (deep diving metaphor)
- **Mobile-First Pacing**: Slow, contemplative scrolling especially on mobile (70% traffic)

## Interaction Design

### **Animation Philosophy**
- **Slow & Gentle**: Everything moves with contemplative timing
- **Smooth Transitions**: Gentle fades, no jarring changes
- **Progressive Revelation**: Content appears as user scrolls (self-awareness metaphor)
- **Depth Illusion**: Subtle parallax and 3D effects for groundedness

### **Micro-Interactions**
- **Mouse Following**: Elements subtly respond to cursor movement
- **Hover Effects**: Sharp, professional but subtle responses
- **Scroll-Triggered**: Background animations, particle effects for depth
- **Progressive Enhancement**: More details revealed as user explores

### **Scroll Experience**
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Floating through content, not jumping between sections
- **Parallax Depth**: Different elements move at different speeds
- **Paced Revelation**: Pain points spread out, allowing individual resonance
- **Seamless Transitions**: No abrasive section changes or light/dark alternating

## Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

### **Visual Elements to Avoid**
- ❌ Bright, stimulating colors
- ❌ Testimonial carousels
- ❌ Urgency timers or countdown clocks
- ❌ Traditional section dividers (lines between sections)
- ❌ Light/dark/light section alternating
- ❌ Cliché "transformation" imagery

### **Language/Messaging to Avoid**
- ❌ "Transformation" language
- ❌ Typical coaching clichés
- ❌ High-pressure urgency copy
- ❌ Traditional self-help terminology

### **Interaction Patterns to Avoid**
- ❌ Quick, snappy animations
- ❌ Overwhelming multiple elements on screen
- ❌ Aggressive calls-to-action
- ❌ Distracting visual elements

## Professional Standards

### **Technical Excellence**
- **Pixel-Perfect Alignment**: Every element precisely positioned
- **Consistent Spacing**: Mathematical spacing system throughout
- **Clean Edges**: Crisp buttons, sharp hover effects
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations, fast loading

### **Depth & Dimension**
- **3D Illusion**: Subtle depth without being gimmicky
- **Layered Elements**: Background, midground, foreground separation
- **Particle Systems**: Subtle background effects for depth
- **Material Feel**: Clay/stone-like textures that feel tactile

### **Mobile-First Considerations**
- **Touch-Friendly**: 44px minimum touch targets
- **Thumb Navigation**: Important elements within thumb reach
- **Smooth Touch Scrolling**: Momentum and inertia feel natural
- **Responsive Depth**: 3D effects work well on mobile devices
